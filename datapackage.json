{"name":"nhs-pathways-potential-covid-19-open-data","title":" NHS Pathways Potential COVID-19 Open Data","description":"This data is based on potential COVID-19 symptoms reported by members of the public to NHS Pathways through NHS 111 or 999 and 111 online,  and is not based on the outcomes of tests for coronavirus.\r\n\r\nThis is not a count of people. In 111 online, any user that starts and launches the COVID-19 assessment services is indicating they may have symptoms of coronavirus. They may have accessed the service multiple times with different symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe North East, West Midlands, South East Coast, South Central, and Isle of Wight Ambulance Services use NHS Pathways to triage calls to 999. The North West, Yorkshire, East Midlands, East of England, London, and South Western Ambulance Services use another system to triage calls to 999. Therefore, for CCGs in those areas, data here will not include most 999 calls related to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nNHS Pathways data is sourced from a live system that is updated every 15 minutes. The data is extracted for the dashboard and open data files with as little delay as possible but there can be a time delay between the extraction processes meaning that the dashboard and open data files may have different totals.\r\n\r\nUsers of 111 online can change answers and reach multiple dispositions so the data indicates those users that have started an assessment and completed a final disposition.\r\n\r\nUsers enter their current location which may differ from their home postcode.","licenses":[{"url":"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/","title":"Open Government Licence 3.0 (United Kingdom)"}],"publishers":[{"name":null,"web":null}],"resources":[{"name":"2020-04-13","mediatype":"text/csv","description":"NHS Pathways Covid-19 data as of 2020-04-13 ","path":"data/2020-04-13.csv"}]}
